# SHIKI website revamp
This website is meant to be a revamp of the late SHIKI's website: https://web.archive.org/web/20220412184030/http://shiki2.sakura.ne.jp/

The purpose of the website is to retain the style and vibe of the old website, whilst modernizing it and making it more polished than the website he had made.

# Design process
The website aims to allow users to get news on his latest works, discography, any other news relating to his music, as well as learn more about him and his background.

Firstly, i've done a wireframe mockup in figma to give me a sense of how i'd want the site to look like, (Site: https://www.figma.com/design/WIOOyrcljLG57pHmoZKOno/LINK-TO-YOU%3F?node-id=0-1&t=YsgaKmd9op782WOq-1)

I referenced sites by other music producers, such as Void(mournfinale) (Site:mournfinale.com) and Synthion (Site: https://synthion.space/), taking some elements from each of their websites.

Some user stories I referenced whilst making the site were:
- I want to be able to view all of SHIKI's works easily.
- I wish to easily find and download all of SHIKI's bms works.
- I want to hear about the latest news regarding SHIKI's works.

# Features
Allows you to view all the latest news and announcements about SHIKI's music from the home page.
Allows you to view all the details about SHIKI's albums and more info about each one of them.
Allows you to easily view and download all of SHIKI's BMS files, as well as learn some additional info on them.
Allows you to easily find out the social media platforms SHIKI is on and where to find his music.
Allows you to find out more about SHIKI as a person in the About page.

# Features left to implement
It would be nice if there could be an embed for the bemuse bms player such that visitors of the site can play the bms straight away without needing to download the files.

# Technologies used
In this project i've only used basic html, css, and javascript to construct the website and have not used any other tools or libraries.

# Testing
I've tested the site for both desktop and mobile view. In both views the site is laid out according to how I imagined, with the album covers and bms thumbnails flexing into fewer columns when using a smaller screen like a mobile phone. When using a Desktop the text and images were also laid out to be large and easy to read. Whilst testing I wasn't able to get the media queries to work as well as I wanted (particularly flex-direction), hence that leaves some room for improvement.
