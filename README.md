# SHIKI website revamp
This website is meant to be a revamp of the late SHIKI's website: https://web.archive.org/web/20220412184030/http://shiki2.sakura.ne.jp/

The purpose of the website is to retain the style and vibe of the old website, whilst modernizing it and making it more polished than the website he had made.

#Design process
The website aims to allow users to get news on his latest works, discography, any other news relating to his music, as well as learn more about him and his background.

Firstly, i've done a wireframe mockup in figma to give me a sense of how i'd want the site to look like, (Site: https://www.figma.com/design/WIOOyrcljLG57pHmoZKOno/LINK-TO-YOU%3F?node-id=0-1&t=YsgaKmd9op782WOq-1)

I referenced sites by other music producers, such as Void(mournfinale) (Site:mournfinale.com) and Synthion (Site: https://synthion.space/), taking some elements from each of their websites.

Some user stories I referenced whilst making the site were:
- I want to be able to view all of SHIKI's works easily.
- I wish to easily find and download all of SHIKI's bms works.
